# student_score_prediction
## Project Overview
In this project, I will analyze data related to students' study hours and the scores they earn. The main objective of this analysis is to build a prediction model that can estimate students's scores based on their number of study hours.
## Data Overview
The dataset contains two columns:
* Hours: Number of hours studied by a student.
* Scores: Score obtained by the student.
The dataset is consistent, with no missing values or duplicates, and shows a positive correlation between study hours and scores.
## Tools Used
* Microsoft Excel
* Google Colab
## Conclusion
* Linear Regression: More suited for a linear relationship between study hours and scores, providing stable and consistent predictions.
* Decision Tree: Captures complex relationships but may be less efficient due to potential overfitting.
## Recommendation
1. Use Linear Regression for efficient predictions in this case.
2. Optimize the Decision Tree with hyperparameter tuning to improve its performance.
3. Use Cross-Validation to ensure stable model performance and avoid overfitting.
